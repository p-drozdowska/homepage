My first test website built to become familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of week 8 of CS50x course.

## About
The requirements of the problem set were to build a simple website of at least 4 pages, using no less than 10 different HTML tags, 5 different CSS selectors and properties, and at least 1 Javascript feature.

### The website features include:
- Custom formatted background, text alignment, text style
- Header with a menu bar, with selection changing background on hover and an indicator of current page
- Simple table with alternating row background colour
- Gallery of 4 images in a 2x2 grid, text appearing on hover
- Integration of the Bootstrap library alert feature
- Date & time display button in Javascript
